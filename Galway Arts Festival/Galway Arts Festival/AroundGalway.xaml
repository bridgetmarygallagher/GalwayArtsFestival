A big town to some, a small city to others, this International centre of cultural excellence manages to achieve what few other destinations can - to mix culture, entertainment, intellect and fun to create the very unique and much-loved atmosphere.

Despite Galway's seemingly cosy size, this powerhouse of a city is known for its talented and highly educated workforce, resulting a world class hub of technological, industrial and agricultural excellence.

What really makes this Celtic city so magnetic though, is its extraordinarily immersive cultural, dance, musical, artisan, foodie and outdoor scene...the perfect experiential destination mix. 

Galway's City Centre is a unique labyrinth of winding medieval streets, squares and waterways - a streetscape that lends itself beautifully to the extraordinary, buzzing almost magical atmosphere. 

This, along with Galway's love of the 'good times', makes it the perfect backdrop for one of Europe's best loved arts festivals...The Galway International Arts Festival."

            <TextBlock Height="406" TextWrapping="Wrap" Text="Galway City originally formed from a small fishing village located in the area near the Spanish Arch called 'The Claddagh' where the River Corrib meets Galway Bay. Galway later became a walled town in the year 1232 after the territory was captured by the Anglo Normans lead by Richard De Burgo. The town walls, some sections of which can be seen today near the Spanish Arch, were constructed circa 1270. A charter was granted in 1396 by Richard II which transferred governing powers to 14 merchant families, known locally as the 14 tribes of Galway. 

The 14 tribes relished their independence but retained their close links to the British crown. Galway's strategic coastal location and natural harbour area resulted in a successful trade with both Portugal and Spain and the city prospered for centuries. However in 1651 with the arrival of Cromwell the region entered a long period of decline. Other prominent sea ports emerged on the east coast, namely Dublin and Waterford and trade with Spain came almost at an end. Many years would pass before Galway would again enjoy such prosperity but the legacy of the cities long and colourful history is evident in the character and style of the city.
